# E-Commerce data Analytics and Data Processing with Python (pandas)


## Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive workflow for analyzing a shipment and orders dataset, focusing on **data cleaning**, **feature engineering**, and **profitability analysis**. It highlights essential **data analytics skills**, such as preprocessing raw data, deriving key metrics, and preparing datasets for actionable insights.

The project works with real-world data downloaded from **Kaggle** and showcases how **Python's powerful libraries** can transform raw data into meaningful insights for business decision-making.

## Key Features

### 1. **Dataset Acquisition**
- Utilized the Kaggle API to download a shipment orders dataset for analysis.
- Demonstrated file extraction and integration into a structured workflow.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- Handled missing values by replacing invalid entries with NaN.
- Cleaned and standardized column names for easier analysis.
- Converted date columns into appropriate formats for **time-series analysis**.

### 3. **Feature Engineering**
- Created new columns such as **Unit Selling Price** and **Unit Profit** using domain-specific calculations.
- Removed unnecessary columns to optimize the dataset for analysis.

### 4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyzed unique values in categorical columns like **Ship Mode** to understand operational trends.
- Prepared data summaries for insights into business performance.

### 5. **Profitability Insights**
- Calculated profitability by integrating cost price and selling price data.
- Provided insights into pricing strategies with a calculated **Discount Percent**.
